# Encryptr
üõ°Ô∏è Next-level encrypting software.

This is a high-school project I, [Vitor](https://github.com/VitorGouveia) made for fun, the point of the project is just to test [`ZenitPolar`](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenit_Polar) and [`ROT13`](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encryption methods, but as you can see I came here and made whole documentation for this project, I also made a figma for this, [check it out](https://www.figma.com/file/plTBuSRfWC5Nwq289A8OYW/Encryptr?node-id=0%3A1);

I explain some of the internal workings of the code on my [notion documentation](https://vitorgouveia.notion.site/Encryptr-e357c4dc44d240beb21d4418c689d79a), but it is simply a typescript "library" built with some SOLID principles that implements the two encrypting methods I mentioned earlier, of course, I am using this project to try out new stuff, such as [`Nuxt.js`](https://nuxtjs.org) and [`Vue`](https://vuejs.org), which I used to build the main website, and [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), which I used to build the exact documentation you're reading right now.

I talk more about my experience on [notion](https://vitorgouveia.notion.site/Encryptr-e357c4dc44d240beb21d4418c689d79a) and [github readme](https://github.com/vitorGouveia/Encryptr), or you could just follow me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitor-gouveia) and read my post about building this project.

Thank you for reading.
